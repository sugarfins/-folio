<br/>
I've been language-obsessed since childhood and this has followed me throughout my academic and professional career. I'm currently set to graduate in May 2019 from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) with a MA in Translation and Localization Management. 

In my free time, I like to go hiking, cook and watch cooking shows, and play board games.

Here you can find write-ups for some [final projects](https://sugarfins.github.io/) I made for various courses during my studies, a few [blogposts](https://sugarfins.github.io/blog/) about things that interest me, and my [resume](https://sugarfins.github.io/resume/).
