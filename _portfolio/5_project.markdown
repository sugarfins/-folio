### Introduction and an Overview

In my first semester at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, one of my courses was an introductory course in computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools. Over the course of the semester, I learned how to utilize SDL Trados, knowledge which I applied in my final project.
For my final project, I worked in a group to localize a simplified version of the [Boba Guys](http://www.bobaguys.com/) (\**the website has since changed in layout*) website into Simplified Chinese, with the help of SDL Trados and other tools, including TeamWeek and Squarespace.

One of the main takeaways from this experience was learning how to manipulate the file type filters in Trados, specifically the HTML file type filter, to pull translatable content from a website.

Additionally, it was heartening to see that Squarespace *was* as simple to use as they proclaimed, and creating a mock website as well as the localized version did not take a long amount of time.

### Included in the Project Folder

There are 4 main categories to the project files:
* *Project Proposal and Goals:* Included is a Statement of Work that we created at the beginning of our project, clearly outlining our project goals and deliverables.
* *Website URLs and full website files:* Included in the folder is a document with links to the mock squarespace sites. However, because these sites were built on a trial basis, these urls are now defunct. For this reason, I have included the full website files in downloadable zip files.
* *SDL Trados and translation files:* These files include the pseudo-translation files created at the beginning of the project, the translated XLIFF files used in Trados, and the translated text from the image files. This also included the termbase and translation memory (TM) that we created at the end of the translation process.
* *Final Presentation:* This is the file for our final presentation, in which we go in depth about missteps, challenges, and what we learned through the process.
